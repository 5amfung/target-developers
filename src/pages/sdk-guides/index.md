# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation portal for Adobe Target's server-side SDKs!

Through Adobe Target's server-side SDKs, you can:

* Execute and run **feature flagging**, **rollouts**, and **A/B experiments** at **near-zero latency**.
* Deliver experiences across **web**, including **SPAs**, and **mobile channels**, as well as non-browser based **Internet of Things (IoT) devices** such as a connected TV, kiosk, or in-store digital screen.
* Deliver **Machine Learning (ML) driven personalized experiences** to a user, no matter which channel or device the user has engaged with your business.
* **Seamlessly integrate with Adobe Experience Cloud** products such as **Adobe Analytics**, **Adobe Audience Manager**, and the **Experience Cloud ID Service** from the server side.

See the [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) page to learn how to run a simple feature flagging use case via [on-device decisioning](../on-device-decisioning/).

See the [SDK References](../sdk/) to familiarize yourself with each API method.

Check out our [Sample Apps](/sample-apps.md) to have fun and play around!
