# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation portal for Adobe Target's server-side SDKs!

Through Adobe Target's server-side SDKs, you can:

* Execute and run feature flagging, rollouts, and A/B experiments at near-zero latency.
* Deliver experiences across web, including SPAs, and mobile channels, as well as non-browser based IoT devices such as a connected TV, kiosk, or in-store digital screen.
* Deliver ML-driven personalized experiences to a user no matter which channel or device the user has engaged with your business.
* Seamlessly integrate with Adobe Experience Cloud products such as Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager, and the Experience Cloud ID Service from the server side.

See the *Getting Started* section to learn how to run a simple feature flagging use case via *on-device decisioning*.

See the *SDK Reference Guides* to familiarize yourself with each API method.

Check out our *Sample Apps* to have fun and play around!
