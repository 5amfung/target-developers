>[!NOTE]

>There are important distinctions between Target Admin APIs (including the Recommendations APIs) and Target Delivery APIs:
>
>* Admin APIs let you configure various aspects of Target that you could also configure in the Target UI. Admin APIs require authentication.
>
>* Delivery APIs let you retrieve content. Delivery APIs do not require authentication.
>
>To use Target Admin APIs, you first need to configure authentication using Adobe I/O. For more information, see [How to Configure Authentication](../guides/index.md).
